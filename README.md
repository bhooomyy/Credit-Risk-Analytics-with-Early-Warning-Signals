# 📊 Credit Risk Analytics with Early Warning Signals  
**Lending Club Loan Portfolio (Kaggle)**

---

## Executive Summary
This project implements a **production-style credit risk analytics pipeline** using Lending Club loan-level data. It demonstrates how financial institutions ingest raw loan data, engineer risk signals, and build **early-warning systems** to proactively identify loans with elevated default risk.

The solution mirrors **real-world banking analytics workflows**, including chunked ingestion of large datasets, canonical risk labeling, early-warning signal engineering, and portfolio-level risk segmentation suitable for management reporting.

This project is designed to reflect **senior-level analyst / analytics engineer responsibilities** in credit risk, portfolio analytics, and early-warning monitoring.

## 🔍 Business Problem
Banks and lenders must detect **early signs of borrower distress** before loans become delinquent or default. Loan status alone is insufficient; proactive risk management requires:

- Monitoring revolving credit utilization  
- Identifying shrinking credit buffers  
- Measuring borrower leverage relative to income  
- Segmenting portfolio risk for actionability  

This project answers:
> *“Which loans show early-warning signals today, and how concentrated is portfolio risk?”*

### Technology Stack
- **Python (pandas)** – large-file ingestion & data standardization  
- **MySQL 8** – analytical SQL, risk logic, portfolio aggregation  
- **GitHub** – version-controlled, reproducible analytics project

## 📁 Data Ingestion & Processing
### Python Processing
- Processes large CSV files using **chunked reads (200k rows)**  
- Loads only **analytically relevant columns**  
- Standardizes:
  - Dates (`issue_d`, `last_pymnt_d`, `last_credit_pull_d`)
  - Percent fields (`int_rate`, `revol_util`)
  - Loan term (`36 / 60 months`)
  - Numeric identifiers and financial fields  

**Output**
- `loan_core.csv` – clean, analysis-ready dataset for SQL processing  

---

## 🧠 Risk Labeling Logic
Each loan is assigned canonical risk indicators using **industry-aligned definitions**.

### Default Flag
A loan is flagged as defaulted if:
- `Charged Off`
- `Default`
- `Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off`

```sql
default_flag = 1

### Risk State Classification

| Loan Status Category            | Risk State |
|---------------------------------|------------|
| Charged Off / Default           | DEFAULT    |
| Late / Grace Period             | LATE       |
| Fully Paid                      | PAID       |
| Current                         | CURRENT    |

## 🚨 Early Warning Signal Engineering (EWS)

Early-warning signals are engineered using **credit risk best practices** to detect signs of borrower financial stress **before delinquency occurs**.

### Signals Implemented

| Signal                          | Definition                                |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **High Credit Utilization**     | `revol_util ≥ 80%`                        |
| **Low Available Credit Buffer** | `(total_rev_hi_lim − revol_bal) < $5,000` |
| **High Borrower Leverage**      | `loan_amnt / annual_inc > 40%`            |

### Composite Early Warning Flag

early_warning_flag = 1

## 🎯 Risk Bucketing Strategy

Loans are segmented into **actionable portfolio risk buckets** to support **risk monitoring, prioritization, and intervention strategies**.  
This bucketing framework enables efficient portfolio oversight and targeted risk management.

| Risk Bucket | Definition                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **DEFAULT** | Loan has defaulted                |
| **HIGH**    | Loan is currently late            |
| **MEDIUM**  | Early-warning signals are present |
| **LOW**     | No early-warning signals detected |

This structured classification supports **portfolio-level risk assessment**, **exposure concentration analysis**, and **early-stage intervention planning**.
